# OpenSearch Agentic Memory Demo

This repository demonstrates how to integrate OpenSearch's Agentic Memory capabilities with popular AI agent frameworks like Strands and LangGraph. The demo showcases persistent memory management for AI agents, enabling them to maintain context across sessions and conversations.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed, then

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Strands Agents (Short-term memory)

1. Set environment variables

```bash
# OpenSearch domain configuration (Required)
export OPENSEARCH_URL=<your_opensearch_cluster_endpoint>
export OPENSEARCH_USERNAME=<your_opensearch_domain_username>
export OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD=<your_opensearch_domain_password>

# Memory and session configuration (Optional)
export MEMORY_CONTAINER_NAME=<your_memory_container_name>               # Defaults to 'strands_short_term'
export MEMORY_CONTAINER_DESCRIPTION=<your_memory_container_description> # Defaults to 'OpenSearch Strands demo memory container'
export SESSION_ID=<your_session_id>                                     # Defaults to 'strands_short_term_session'
```

2. Set AWS credentials for Amazon Bedrock model

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_aws_access_key>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_aws_secret_key>
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<your_aws_session_token>
```

3. Run the script

```bash
python strands/strands_short_term.py
```

The script creates an interactive chat session where you can converse with the AI agent. The agent maintains conversation history using OpenSearch's persistent memory.

- Enter your messages at the "You:" prompt
- Type `q` or `quit` to exit

**Example conversation:**
```
Created memory container with id 'Wac4o5oB6Os6SYy-CAwu'
OpenSearch Agentic Memory Demo - Session: demo_session
Type 'q' or 'quit' to end the conversation

👤 You: Hello, my name is Bob and I enjoy swimming.
🤖 Assistant: Hi Bob! Nice to meet you. Swimming is a great exercise!

👤 You: Do you remember my name?
🤖 Assistant: Yes, your name is Bob. You mentioned it when you introduced yourself.

👤 You: q
🤖 Assistant: Goodbye!
```

## Strands Agents (Long-term memory)

1. Set environment variables

```bash
# OpenSearch domain configuration (Required)
export OPENSEARCH_URL=<your_opensearch_cluster_endpoint>
export OPENSEARCH_USERNAME=<your_opensearch_domain_username>
export OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD=<your_opensearch_domain_password>

# Model configuration (Optional - auto-created if not provided)
export EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID=<your_embedding_model_id>        # Defaults to Amazon Titan Embedding model
export LLM_MODEL_ID=<your_llm_model_id>                    # Default to Amazon Bedrock Claude model

# Memory and session configuration (Optional)
export MEMORY_CONTAINER_NAME=<your_memory_container_name>  # Defaults to 'strands_long_term'
export SESSION_ID=<your_session_id>                        # Defaults to 'strands_long_term_session'
export USER_ID=<your_user_id>                              # Defaults to 'strands_user'
export AGENT_ID=<your_agent_id>                            # Defaults to 'strands_agent'

# Tool configuration (Optional)
export BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT=<true/false>                    # Defaults to true
```

2. Set AWS credentials (required for automatic model creation)

```bash
export AWS_REGION=<your_aws_region>
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_aws_access_key>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_aws_secret_key>
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<your_aws_session_token>
```

> Note: AWS credentials are only required if you don't provide `EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID` or `LLM_MODEL_ID`. The system will automatically create Amazon Bedrock models using these credentials

3. Run the script

```bash
python strands/strands_long_term.py
```

The script creates an interactive chat session with long-term memory capabilities. Unlike short-term memory, this agent can remember information across different sessions and uses semantic search to retrieve relevant memories based on meaning.

- Enter your messages at the "You:" prompt
- Type `q` or `quit` to exit

**Example conversation:**
```
% python strands/strands_long_term.py
Created embedding model with id 'tqfkp5oB6Os6SYy-CA32'
Created LLM model with id 'uKfkp5oB6Os6SYy-CQ18'
Created memory container with id 'uqfkp5oB6Os6SYy-CQ2t'

Based on the search results, I can see that I have information about you! According to my memories:

**Your name:** Bob

**Your current hobby:** You now like playing basketball (you previously liked swimming but changed your preference)

So yes, I know that your name is Bob and your current hobby is playing basketball. I also remember that you used to like swimming but switched to preferring basketball instead.

👤 You: Can you summarize what we discussed?
🤖 Assistant: Sure, here's a summary of our discussion:

You introduced yourself as Sarah and said you love to bake. When I asked about your baking hobby, you specifically mentioned that you like to bake pies. I then asked some follow-up questions about what kinds of pies you enjoy making - fruit pies, cream pies, savory pies, etc. I also asked about whether you make your own pie crust from scratch or use a pre-made crust. I commented that achieving a perfect, flaky pie crust can be challenging and said I'd be interested in any tips or secrets you've learned for baking great pies. Finally, you checked to make sure I had retained your name (Sarah) and your stated hobby (baking, specifically pies).

👤 You: q

👤 You: Hello, my name is Saran and I love to bake!
⚠️  No checkpoint found for thread_id=demo_20251124_100223, checkpoint_ns=, checkpoint_id=None
🤖 Assistant: Hello Saran, it's great to meet a fellow baking enthusiast! Baking is such a wonderful hobby - there's nothing quite like the delicious aroma of freshly baked goods wafting through the kitchen. What are some of your favorite things to bake? I personally love making breads, cookies, and pies from scratch. The process of precisely measuring ingredients, kneading dough, and watching baked goods rise in the oven is so satisfying. Do you have any go-to recipes you'd recommend or baking tips to share?

👤 You: I like to bake a pie
🤖 Assistant: Wonderful, pies are such a classic baked good! There are so many delicious varieties to choose from - fruit pies, cream pies, savory pies. Do you have a favorite type of pie you enjoy baking? 

Some tips for baking great pies:

- Use cold ingredients for the crust - this helps create a flakier texture when baked.
- Don't overwork the pie dough when mixing and rolling it out. Handling it too much can cause the dough to become tough.
- For fruit pies, let the filling cool slightly before adding it to the unbaked crust so it doesn't make the bottom soggy.
- Brush the top crust with an egg wash or milk before baking for a beautiful golden brown color.
- Let pies cool completely on a wire rack before slicing to allow the filling to set properly.

I'd love to hear about your favorite pie recipe and any special tips or techniques you use when baking pies! Swapping baking wisdom is half the fun for pie enthusiasts.
